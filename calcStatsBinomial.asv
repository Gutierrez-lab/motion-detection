% Calculate estimated mean and variance for column vectors in a dataset
% binaryDataMatrix, collected from a binomial distribution.

function [mu_hat, sigma_hat] = calcStatsBinomial(binaryDataMatrix)

n = size(binaryDataMatrix, 1);

% mu_hat = n * p_hat, and since p_hat = sum(binaryDataMatrix) ./ n, then
% the ns divide themselves out, and we're left with the equation below
mu_hat = sum(binaryDataMatrix);

sigma_hat = sqrt()
p_hat = sum(binaryDataMatrix) ./ n;
mu_hat = n .* p_hat;
